# unity3D-designPatterns
a 3D demo that implements strategy and composite design pattern to create a skill system for an RPG type

1. Strategy Pattern: This pattern is used to create different targeting, effect and filtering techniques for different skills.
2. Composite Pattern: This pattern is used as a complex container for the effects. The composite effects include:
  - Sequence: allows each effect in an array of effects to be called after the previous effect is finished
  - Action after anim: allows an array of effects to be called after an event in animation is called
